House Price Prediction with Regression Models

This project is a machine learning pipeline for predicting house prices using different regression models.
The dataset used is similar to the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
	â€¢	Goal: Predict the house sale price (SalePrice) based on various house features.
	â€¢	Techniques Used:
	â€¢	Data cleaning & handling missing values with SimpleImputer
	â€¢	Feature encoding for categorical data
	â€¢	Feature selection using:
	â€¢	Random Forest feature importance
	â€¢	Correlation analysis
	â€¢	Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
	â€¢	Scaling features using RobustScaler and StandardScaler
	â€¢	Training and comparing 3 models:
	â€¢	Linear Regression
	â€¢	Random Forest Regressor
	â€¢	Gradient Boosting Regressor
	â€¢	Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²
	â€¢	Residual plots for error analysis

ðŸ“Š Results
	â€¢	Models compared: Random Forest, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting
	â€¢	Best performance achieved with Gradient Boosting (after hyperparameter tuning).
	â€¢	Metrics:
	â€¢	MAE: (example) ~18,000
	â€¢	RMSE: (example) ~25,000
	â€¢	RÂ²: (example) ~0.85

Note: The results may vary depending on the dataset version and parameters.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
	â€¢	Use cross-validation instead of a single train-test split
	â€¢	Automate preprocessing with Pipelines
	â€¢	Experiment with XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
	â€¢	Deploy the best model with Flask/FastAPI + Docker
